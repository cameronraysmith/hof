The Walkthrough will take you on a tour of hof's features,
covering the end-to-end developer experience. 
We will build a generator for a full-stack application
with multiple services and languages.

We will primarily be using using Go, JS, and SQL amongst other languages.

Each section will build on the previous
and introduce more of hof's concepts.
By the end you'll see all of the parts needed
to create and use a __hof generator__.
