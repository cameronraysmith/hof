  How to get help and support for __hof__
---

## Community Support

You can get help & support in the community:

- __[Chat on Discord](https://discord.gg/BXwX7n6B8w)__, the preferred chat because Discord does not limit history.
- __[Github Discussions](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/discussions)__ are used for long-term recording of important questions and topics.
- __[Github Issues](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/issues)__ to file bugs and feature requests.
- __[Chat on Slack]({{<slackLink>}})__. Use __[this link for an invite](https://join.slack.com/t/hofstadter-io/shared_invite/zt-e5f90lmq-u695eJur0zE~AG~njNlT1A)__. We monitor this less since Slack has become, post acquisition, less ideal for open source communities.
